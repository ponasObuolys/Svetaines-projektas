# Project Roadmap

## Overview

This project aims to develop a dynamic system comprising:

- **Admin Panel (`/admin`)**: An interface for administrators to manage a catalog of dishes, including adding, updating, and removing items.
- **TV Display (`/tv`)**: A public-facing page that showcases available dishes in real-time, reflecting updates made through the admin panel.

## Milestones

### 1. Project Initialization

- **Set Up Development Environment**
  - Initialize a new React project with Vite and TypeScript.
  - Configure ESLint and Prettier for code quality and consistency.
  - Establish a Git repository for version control.

- **Define Project Structure**
  - Organize folders and files following best practices for scalability and maintainability.
  - Create a `src` directory with subdirectories for components, pages, services, and utilities.

### 2. Admin Panel Development

- **Authentication and Authorization**
  - Implement user authentication to secure the admin panel.
  - Set up role-based access control to restrict functionalities appropriately.

- **Dish Management Features**
  - Develop CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for dish entries.
  - Include form validations and error handling mechanisms.

- **Real-Time Updates**
  - Integrate WebSocket or Server-Sent Events (SSE) to push updates to the TV display instantly when changes occur in the admin panel.

### 3. TV Display Development

- **User Interface Design**
  - Design a responsive and visually appealing layout suitable for large screens.
  - Ensure accessibility standards are met.

- **Data Fetching and State Management**
  - Implement data fetching mechanisms to retrieve the current list of available dishes.
  - Manage state efficiently to reflect real-time updates from the admin panel.

### 4. Integration and Testing

- **API Development**
  - Develop RESTful APIs or GraphQL endpoints to facilitate communication between the admin panel and the TV display.

- **Testing**
  - Write unit tests for individual components and functions.
  - Develop integration tests to ensure seamless interaction between the admin panel and TV display.
  - Conduct end-to-end testing to simulate real-world usage scenarios.

### 5. Deployment and Monitoring

- **Deployment**
  - Set up continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines to automate the deployment process.
  - Deploy the application to a cloud platform or on-premises server as per project requirements.

- **Monitoring and Maintenance**
  - Implement logging and monitoring tools to track application performance and errors.
  - Establish a maintenance plan for regular updates and feature enhancements.

| TV Display Development    | 2 weeks              |
| Integration and Testing   | 2 weeks              |
| Deployment and Monitoring | 1 week               |

*Note: Timelines are estimates and may vary based on project scope and resource availability.*

## Dependencies and Resources

- **Technologies**
  - React, Vite, TypeScript
  - State Management: Redux or Context API
  - Real-Time Communication: WebSocket or Server-Sent Events (SSE)
  - Styling: CSS-in-JS solutions like styled-components or traditional CSS/SASS

- **Resources**
  - Design mockups and wireframes
  - API documentation
  - Access to development and production servers

## Risks and Mitigations

- **Scope Creep**
  - *Mitigation*: Define clear project requirements and obtain stakeholder approval before development begins.

- **Technical Challenges**
  - *Mitigation*: Allocate time for research and prototyping during the initial phases.

- **Resource Constraints**
  - *Mitigation*: Ensure the team has the necessary skills and tools; consider training sessions if needed.
