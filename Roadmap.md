# Project Roadmap

## Overview

This project aims to develop a dynamic system comprising:

- **Admin Panel (`/admin`)**: An interface for administrators to manage a catalog of dishes, including adding, updating, and removing items.
- **TV Display (`/tv`)**: A public-facing page that showcases available dishes in real-time, reflecting updates made through the admin panel.

**Note**: Authentication will utilize a hardcoded admin login, and all product data will be managed locally within the application state.

## Milestones

### 1. Project Initialization

- **Set Up Development Environment**
  - Initialize a new React project with Vite and TypeScript.
  - Configure ESLint and Prettier for code quality and consistency.
  - Establish a Git repository for version control.

- **Define Project Structure**
  - Organize folders and files following best practices for scalability and maintainability.
  - Create a `src` directory with subdirectories for components, pages, services, and utilities.

### 2. Admin Panel Development

- **Authentication Implementation**
  - Develop a login component that validates user credentials against hardcoded values (`username: admin`, `password: admin123`).
  - Implement client-side routing to restrict access to the admin panel for unauthorized users.

- **Dish Management Features**
  - Design and implement functionality to add, update, and remove dishes within the application state.
  - Ensure form validations and error handling mechanisms are in place.

- **State Persistence**
  - Utilize browser's `localStorage` to persist dish data and authentication status, ensuring data remains consistent across sessions. citeturn0search11

### 3. TV Display Development

- **User Interface Design**
  - Design a responsive and visually appealing layout suitable for large screens.
  - Ensure accessibility standards are met.

- **Data Rendering**
  - Fetch and display the list of available dishes from the local application state or `localStorage`.
  - Implement real-time updates to reflect changes made in the admin panel.

### 4. Integration and Testing

- **Component Integration**
  - Ensure seamless interaction between the admin panel and TV display components.
  - Implement state management solutions to facilitate data sharing between components.

- **Testing**
  - Write unit tests for individual components and functions.
  - Develop integration tests to ensure cohesive functionality between the admin panel and TV display.
  - Conduct end-to-end testing to simulate real-world usage scenarios.

### 5. Deployment and Monitoring

- **Deployment**
  - Prepare the application for deployment by building optimized production files.
  - Deploy the application to a static hosting service or server as per project requirements.

- **Monitoring and Maintenance**
  - Implement logging mechanisms to track application performance and errors.
  - Establish a maintenance plan for regular updates and feature enhancements.

## Timeline

| Milestone                 | Estimated Completion |
|---------------------------|----------------------|
| Project Initialization    | 1 week               |
| Admin Panel Development   | 2 weeks              |
| TV Display Development    | 1 week               |
| Integration and Testing   | 1 week               |
| Deployment and Monitoring | 1 week               |

*Note: Timelines are estimates and may vary based on project scope and resource availability.*

## Dependencies and Resources

- **Technologies**
  - React, Vite, TypeScript
  - State Management: Context API or Redux
  - Routing: React Router
  - Styling: CSS-in-JS solutions like styled-components or traditional CSS/SASS

- **Resources**
  - Design mockups and wireframes
  - Access to development and production environments

## Risks and Mitigations

- **Security Concerns**
  - *Mitigation*: Clearly communicate that the hardcoded credentials are for development or internal use only and should not be used in production environments.

- **Data Persistence Issues**
  - *Mitigation*: Implement thorough testing to ensure data stored in `localStorage` is managed correctly and persists as expected.

- **Scalability Limitations**
  - *Mitigation*: Acknowledge that storing data locally is suitable for small-scale applications; plan for potential future integration with a backend service if scalability becomes a requirement.
